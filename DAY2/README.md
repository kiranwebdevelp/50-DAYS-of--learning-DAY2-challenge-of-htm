## TOPIC :
- **Day 2:** HTML Tags and Elements ,What are HTML tags and elements ? Understanding opening and closing tags.Self-Closing tags.

## Overview
- **HTML Tags and Elements:**   HTML Tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They define how the content should be displayed on a webpage. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. They are surrounded by angle brackets `(< >)`.


  `Example`:
  `<p>` is the opening tag, 
        and `</p>` is the closing tag for a paragraph.

- **HTML Elements:**    HTML Elements refer to the combination of the opening tag, content, and closing tag. Elements are the actual content you see on the webpage.   

  `Example`:
`<p>`This is a paragraph.`</p>`
   Here, `<p>` is the tag, and the entire structure is the 
     element.

- **Understanding Opening and Closing Tags:**   
  `Opening Tag:` This tells the browser that this is the start of an element. 
  
  `Example:` `<h1>`.

  `Closing Tag:` This tells the browser that this is the end of the element. Closing tags are indicated by a forward slash `/` before the tag name. 
  
  `Example:` `</h1>`.

  `Example:` 
   `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`

  `In this case` : `<h1>` is the opening tag, and `</h1>` is the closing tag. The text `"Hello World!"` is wrapped inside the `h1` element.
  
-  **Self-Closing Tags:**  Some elements do not require closing tags because they donâ€™t wrap around content. These are called 
  `self-closing tags`.
  
    `Examples of self-closing tags include:`

        <img />: for adding images
        <br />: for line breaks
        <hr />: for horizontal rules

    Notice that self-closing tags have a forward slash `/` at the 
    end of the tag to indicate they close within themselves.
